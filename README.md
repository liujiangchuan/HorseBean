# HorseBean
========
HorseBean is an easy structure for Android APP development.
It offers utils and mature common code for saving developers' time and making code more robust and reliable.

Code Structure
--------
By opening the project, you will see an 'app' project and a 'services' lib in HorseBean.
The 'services' is the core structure and the 'app' is a demo I want tell how the services lib works.

Import lib
--------
* butterknife
* glide
* gson
* okhttp
* rxjava
* rxandroid
* leakcanary
* umeng

Todo
--------
* I've already shared the structure and idea to my colleagues, and I plan to write a blog about more details in building HorseBean for more people.
* Develop on the demo to show more features in HorseBean.
* Add login module.
* Add share module.

Thank you

Looking forward to your suggestion and advice.
